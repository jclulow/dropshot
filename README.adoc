= Dropshot

image::https://github.com/oxidecomputer/dropshot/workflows/Rust/badge.svg[]

Dropshot is a general-purpose crate for exposing REST APIs from a Rust program.
For more, see the https://docs.rs/dropshot/[online Dropshot documentation].
You can build the documentation yourself with:

[source,text]
----
$ cargo +nightly doc
----


== Contributing

=== Building and testing

You can **build and run the whole test suite** with `cargo test`.  The test
suite runs cleanly and should remain clean.

=== Code formatting

Dropshot works with stable Rust versions, but for consistency the code is
_formatted_ with a specific version of `rustfmt`.  To contribute to Dropshot,
you will need to have installed the `nightly-2020-07-26` version of the Rust
toolchain:

----
$ rustup install nightly-2020-07-26
----

You can then **format the code** using `cargo +nightly-2020-07-26 fmt` or
`rustfmt +nightly-2020-07-26`.  Make sure to run this before pushing changes.
The CI uses this version of `rustfmt` to check that the code is correctly
formatted.


== Configuration reference

=== Dropshot servers

Dropshot servers use a TOML configuration file.  Supported config properties
include:

[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Example
|Required?
|Description

|`bind_address`
|`"127.0.0.1:12220"`
|Yes
|Specifies that the server should bind to the given IP address and TCP port.  In general, servers can bind to more than one IP address and port, but this is not (yet?) supported.

|===

=== Logging

Dropshot provides a small wrapper to configure a slog-based Logger.  You can use
this without using the rest of Dropshot.  Logging config properties include:

[cols="1,1,1,3",options="header"]
|===
|Name
|Example
|Required?
|Description

|`mode`
|`"file"`
|Yes
|Controls where server logging will go.  Valid modes are `"stderr-terminal"` and
`"file".  If the mode is `"stderr-terminal"`, human-readable output, with colors
and other terminal formatting if possible, will be sent to stderr.  If the mode
is `"file"`, Bunyan-format output will be sent to the filesystem path given by
`log.path`.  See also `log.if_exists`, which controls the behavior if the
destination path already exists.

|`level`
|`"info"`
|Yes
|Specifies what severity of log messages should be included in the log.  Valid
values include `"trace"`, `"debug"`, `"info"`, `"warn"`, `"error"`, and
`"critical"`, which are increasing order of severity.  Log messages at the
specified level and more severe levels will be included in the log.

|`path`
|`"logs/server.log"`
|Only if `log.mode = "file"`
|If `log.mode` is `"file"`, this property determines the path to the log file.
See also `log.if_exists`.

|`if_exists`
|`"append"`
|Only if `log.mode = "file"`
|If `log.mode` is `"file"`, this property specifies what to do if the
destination log file already exists.  Valid values include `"append"` (which
appends to the existing file), `"truncate"` (which truncates the existing file
and then uses it as though it had just been created), and `"fail"` (which causes
the server to exit immediately with an error).
